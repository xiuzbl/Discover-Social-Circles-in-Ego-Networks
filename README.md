# Discover Social Circles in Ego Networks:

## Introduction:
Reproduce the typical paper of "Learning to Discover Social Circles in Ego Networks" in Python.

## Implementation:
You can implement it in the terminal:
'python main.py'

## Requirements:
packages: munkres, thinqpbo
## Notice: 
1. Since the python library thinqpbo lack the setlabel(,) function, I have manually add it in the QPBO.cpp according to the C++ source code and build the library instead of 'pip install thinqpbo'. 
2. There are small bugs now, I will figure them out before Aug, 2020. But you can still refer to my implementation which will be helpful for understanding the paper.
